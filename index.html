          <p> A limited series podcast examining the history of coding and computers through a queer and feminist lens.  Random Access Memory will discuss forgotten and overlooked contributors essential to the creation of computers and will examine how systems made by queer identities inherently have queer aspects. </p>

                    <p>
                      Audio is an accessible and fun way to engage with content, regardless of density. The history of coding and computing is rich and fascinating, yet largely confined to PDFs and books. Changing the medium it is presented through will provide people interested in the topic but not enough so to sit down and read a book access to that knowledge in a low stakes form.

                      Cool people who have wondered how the little device they use every day came to exist and cool people who didn't think that too, but liked the cover of the podcast and started listening on a whim and never want to stop once they start.

                       I will not be exploring  this topic through an objective observer of history, but instead will be examining the subject through a Queer and Feminist lens. My perspective is informed by my identity as a non-binary lesbian attempting to find a place in the world of coding, web development, and internet art and overall just really interested in this stuff.
